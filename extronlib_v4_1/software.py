class CodecConnect():
    """ This class provides an interface to Extronâ€™s Codec Connect software.

    :Note:: System limits 15 CodecConnect clients per system.

    **Arguments**:
    * **Hostname** (*string*) - Hostname of the host computer. Can be IP Address.
    * **IPPort** (*int*) - IP Port the software is listening on (default is *5000*)
    
    :Note:: Only one object can be instantiated for a given Hostname or IP Address.

    **Parameters**:
    Hostname:- **Returns** (*string*) - Hostname of the host computer
    >**Note**: If unavailable, returns the IP Address.
    IPAddress:- **Returns** (*string*) - IP Address of the host computer
    IPPort:- **Returns** (*int*) - IP Port the software is listening on (default is *5000*)
    ListeningPort:- **Returns** (*int*) - IP Port this CodecConnect instance is listening on for received data

    **Events**:
    Connected: :*Event*:: Triggers when communication is established. The callback takes two arguments. The first one is the *CodecConnect* instance triggering the event and the second one is a string ('*Connected*').
    Disconnected: :*Event*:: Triggers when the communication is broken. The callback takes two arguments. The first one is the *CodecConnect* instance triggering the event and the second one is a string ('*Disconnected*').
    ReceiveData: :*Event*:: Receive Data event handler used for asynchronous transactions. The callback takes two arguments. The first one is the *CodecConnect* instance triggering the event and the second one is a bytes string.
