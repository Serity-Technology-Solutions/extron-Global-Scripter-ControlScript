## Global Scripter

Global Scripter (GS) is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to program
Extron control systems requiring advanced functionality and complex system logic.
The application includes a basic feature set for programming advanced control systems. For
example, Global Scripter allows you to group together multiple IP Link® Pro controllers to
work as a single, large system. This feature is beneficial for programming larger control
systems that require more control ports than are available on a single controller. Controller
groups also reduce the need for long RS-232 cable runs, as a group can span several rooms
instead of being limited to a single room.

## ControlScript

ControlScript is the Extron implementation of Python 3 on IP Link Pro and TouchLink® Pro
hardware. ControlScript provides a set of Python 3 libraries for interfacing with the different
ports on IP Link Pro processors and the different types of objects on TouchLink Pro
touchpanels. ControlScript also allows programmers to leverage the power and flexibility of
the Python 3 language to create robust AV control systems.

ControlScript® is the Extron programming language used to develop control programs on IP Link Pro control processors. It is based on Python 3.5, an object-oriented, general purpose, interpreted, programming language. ControlScript is part of the firmware that is loaded to the IP Link Pro control processors. This documentation covers the libraries, conventions, and other details that make up ControlScript.
